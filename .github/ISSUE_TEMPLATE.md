# How to create a new bounty?

1. To start you'll have to fill out the bounty form below.  

   - If the bounty spans across multiple repositories, consider splitting it in a smaller per-repo bounties if possible.

   - If the bounty is larger than M, then the best known expert in the bounty matter should be consulted and included in an
     "Expert" field in the bounty description.

2. Communicate the bounty to the organisation by submitting the following form:
   https://forms.gle/STSNjTBGygNtTUwLA

   - The bounty will get published on the deora communication channel.

# Bounty sizes

XS / 50 to 200 / DAI
 S / 200 to 350 / DAI
 M / 350 to 550 / DAI
 L / 550 to 900 / DAI
XL / 900 to 1400 / DAI

You can specify the range individually under #Roles 

# Pair programming
If 2 people claim the bounty together, the payout increases by 1.5x.

# Bounty Challenge
Once a bounty is assigned, the worker is asked to start working immediately on the issue.
If the worker feels blocked in execution, he/she has to communicate the tensions to the gardener.
Only if tensions are not reported and the bounty get's no further attention, anyone can challenge the bounty or takeover.
Bounties should be delivered within time, even if work is left to be performed. Leftover work can be tackled by submitting a new bounty with support by the organisation.
Bounty forking: complexity of bounties that has been undersized can be forked out by a new bounty submission.
